### **Education:**
* I am a second year student of the <span title="Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics">*BSUIR*</span> . I study on the specialty <span title="UX/UI designer">*"Engineering-Psychological Maintenance of Information Technologies"*</span>, but trying myself in different parts of the IT-sphere and life in general. In the first year, the university studied the basics of algorithmization and programming in the C++, i.e. I know some base of this language; coursework(creating a console app) was also written in it. A small example of my code taken from coursework:
```c++
    string inputPassword() {
	char ch;
	int next = 0;
	string password;
	do
	{
		ch = _getch();

		if (ch == 13) break;
		if (ch == '\b' && !password.empty())
		{
			cout << '\b';
			cout << ' ';
			cout << '\b';

			password.pop_back();
			continue;
		}
		if (isalnum((unsigned char)ch))
		{
			next++;
			cout << '*';
			password.push_back(ch);
		}

	} while (next < PASSWORD_LENGHT - 1);
	cout << endl;
	return password;
}
```
